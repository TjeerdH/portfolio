                  <h3>Who am I?</h3>
                  <p>My name is Tjeerd Hoekstra, born in 1993 in a small town in the Netherlands.
                  I am a Glider pilot, Airbus A320 captain and a beginning programmer.</p>
                  <h3>Pilot career</h3>
                  <p>It al started when I was 15 and I joined my local gliding club. Here is where I learned to fly.
                    After high school I wen to pilot school. At Oxford Aviation Academy I studied for 18 months to become a pilot.
                    During training I got selected to join easyJet before I even graduaded, which was awesome since I now had a job before finishing pilot school. 

                    In 2014 I started with easyJet as a First Officer on the Airbus A320 in London Stansted. I flew here for about 1,5 years before I was able to transfer to my own country: The Netherlands. Where I was based in Amsterdam Schiphol airport. Flying out of Schiphol was really nice, it was home.

                    After 5,5 years flying as a First Officer I got my upgrade to become a Captain on the Airbus A320. But I had to move to Berlin for this new exciting function. In June 2019 I moved to Berlin for my new role. 1 Year and 5 months later it was over...... easyJet made me redundant because I am young, not married and do not have kids.... Thanks.</p>
                  <h3>Programming</h3>
                  <p> In Oktober 2020 I started with programming, since I was at home all the time anyway and I was looking to learn somethin new. So I started learning Python, which I found was really fun. On this website you will find some of my projects as well as this website. Since it is written with Python. Feel free to contact me, I will try to get back to you as soon as possible.
